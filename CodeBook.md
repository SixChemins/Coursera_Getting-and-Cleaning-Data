###### Data Set Information

The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist
-	***WALKING*** 
-	***WALKING_UPSTAIRS***
-	***WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS***
-	***SITTING***
-	***STANDING***
-	***LAYING***

Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data. 


A video of the experiment including an example of the 6 recorded activities with one of the participants can be seen in the following link: [Web Link](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOEN9W05_4A)


###### Attribute Information 

For each record in the dataset it is provided: 
	
-	Triaxial acceleration from the accelerometer (total acceleration) and the estimated body acceleration. 
-	Triaxial Angular velocity from the gyroscope. 
-	A 561-feature vector with time and frequency domain variables. 
- Its activity label. 
- An identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment. 

###### Output of Script
Measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement used to create independent tidy data set with average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
